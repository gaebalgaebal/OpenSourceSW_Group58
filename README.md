## Project Overview
We aim to develop an open-source program using the **KoELECTRA** model to predict the sentiment of each sentence in product reviews.  
This program will generate labels and scores for each sentiment prediction.  
We plan to visualize these labels and scores using libraries like **pandas** and **seaborn**.  
By analyzing key keywords based on their weights, the program will provide insights for product marketing.  
This will assist users in the decision-making phase, offering a more pleasant marketing experience and helpful keyword analysis for users.
